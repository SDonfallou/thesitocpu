            <h2 style="background-color: white; color: black; border-radius: 5px;"> A gentle introduction to the Central Processing Unit and Assembly language </h2>
             <p id="text_introduction">
                This e-book aims to illustrate the basics of how a computer works, focusing on how a program written in a high-level language ends
                 up being physically executed on a Central Processing Unit (CPU). The e-book is intended to be used in the context of an introductory
                  computer science course at high school or undergraduate level.
                The e-book starts with a concise explanation of the fundamental architecture shared by a wide variety of modern "computers", such as desktop 
                computers, mobile phones or car control units. This is followed by an explanation of the essential elements of the structure of any CPU, and 
                the machine (assembler) language that it can execute. <br>
                 The e-book is based on the associated Educational CPU Visual Simulator pictured on the left, which readers are encouraged to download in 
                 order to experiment and carry out the proposed programming exercises.
                The associated Educational CPU Visual Simulator allows users to visualize with detailed animations the execution of assembly language code.
                 Its main goal is to support novices in understanding the behaviour of the key components of a CPU, focusing on how code written in high-level 
                 languages is actually executed on the hardware of a computer. <br>
                It supports a simplified but representative assembly language of 16 (Data Transfer, Control Flow, Arithmetic-Logic) instructions, with immediate
                 and direct addressing modalities. Instructions and numeric data can be inserted and edited directly in RAM. It is possible to define “labels”
                  to be used as parameters in jump instructions, or as variable identifiers. The speed and level of details of the animations can be controlled 
                  by the users. At any time, it is possible to switch between symbolic and binary representations.
