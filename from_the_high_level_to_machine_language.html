        <h2 style="background-color: white; color: black; border-radius: 5px;"> Translation of high-level language constructs to Assembly/Machine Language</h2>
    </div>
     <div class="page1_text">
         <p class="f_t_hl_machine">
            Most software today is written by programmers in a high-level language, such as C++, Java, or Python. Yet, whatever program <br>
             is executed on a CPU, needs to be specified in its machine-language. How is it possible, then, to run a program written in a high-level language? <br>
            A high-level language can be physically executed on a CPU, which can only "understand" its machine-language, with two main (possibly combined) 
            techniques: interpretation and compilation. In the case of interpretation, each high-level instruction is executed by an "interpreter", a program
             that acts as a sort of virtual CPU, having as its Instruction Set the instructions available in the high-level language. Yet this interpreter,
              in turn, must be executed as a program in machine-language on the real CPU. In the case of compilation, the programs in a high-level language are
               first translated (compiled) to machine language, before being executed on the CPU. <br>
            Yet, programs written in high-level languages use programming constructs such as IF-THEN-ELSE, FOR, WHILE-DO, and so on.
             How can these constructs be translated to machine language, where such high-level instructions are not available? This is possible mainly 
             exploiting the control-flow instructions jump on condition and unconditional jump, as shown in this section with the help of a few concrete examples. <br>
